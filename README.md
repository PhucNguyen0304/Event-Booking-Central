# 🎟️ Event Booking Central

A microservices–based platform for browsing, booking, and managing events. Each Spring Boot service handles a specific domain, communicating via REST, Kafka, and WebSocket through a central API gateway—leveraging Kafka’s asynchronous event streaming to cut average booking confirmation latency from **1000 ms to 300 ms** (⚡ 70% faster). Automated email notifications inform users of key actions (registrations, bookings, cancellations). Secure authentication and role-based access control are enforced with **JWT** and **OAuth2** for robust data protection.
